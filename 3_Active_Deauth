For this lab we will be using active deauthentication to kick a host off a network and get them to re-authenticate.

It will be much the same as passive sniffing, but we will run one extra command.
First make sure that you can find the "Active-Practice" SSID with airodump.

There should be one host connected to it.

Note the BSSID for both the AP and the connected client.

AP BSSID:
Client BSSID:

Now that you have them, in a seperate window you will need to run the following command:

aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <AP MAC> -c <CLIENT MAC> <YOUR ADAPTER INTERFACE>

-0 - means that we are sending de-auth packets
	 the "1" trailing "-0" is the number of deauth packets to send.
-a - Denotes the AP we are targeting
-c - Denotes the client we are targeting
And of course you need to tell it what interface to use.

You should see the host kicked off, and it should be set up to re-authenticate.
Watch for the hash capture!

If it doesn't work, try again. Make sure you are tareting the correct channel!

Once you have recovered the hash, use the same steps as in the previous lab to crack the new Hash.
