Now that your NIC is in promiscuous mode, lets see what WiFi signals are out there!

lets start by just running everything as sudo.
Enter `sudo su`
? What does this command do?

airmon-ng start wlan0

NOTE: You'll see a 524 error, ignore it for now. As long as there is output in airodump it doesn't matter

To listed for any and all signals you can, run the following:
`airodump-ng`

? What does the output look like, what are we seeing?

Lets identify our target, here it should be named `Practice-WiFi`

? What is the ESSID? <Enter here> Practice-Wifi
? What is its MAC? <Enter here>   3C:8C:F8:EC:7E:27?
What Channel is it using? <Enter Here> 1
? What encryption method does it use? <Enter Here> WPA2 (CCMP)
? Does it use PSK? <Y/N>? Y


So we see a lot of output here, but we want to narrow down our focus and only look at the one we care about.
We can do that by filtering!
Use the following command:
`airodump-ng <interface_name> --essid-regex="<First word of the SSID>*"`

? What does the '*' mean in the above command?


If this was run successfully you should now only see 1 ESSID in your output, a much cleaner interface to work with!


Now, when we perform security assessments, we only want to work on our target.
As targeting general AP's that we do not have EXPLICIT permission to work on is highly illegal and could land you jail time.
So make sure all the information you captured above is accurate!


Now we need to capture a 4-way handshake.
? What is the 4-way handshake?
? What will it give us that we can use?


NOTE: (It is highly recommended to use the `~/hacking/` folder for this next part. You may need to make said folder if it doesnt already exist)
To do so, lets use the following command:
`airodump-ng <interface_name> -c <channel the AP is broadcasting on> --bssid <MAC Address> -w psk`

the -w here will write all the pertinent files (to the current directory) at psk*

Now you should see a bunch of `psk-*` files in the current directory once you quit litening.

? What needs to happen in order to capture a 4-way handshake?

NOTE: you will need to be listening with the above command to capture the handshake!

If you see something like the following in first line of airodump-ng:
[ WPA handshake: <MAC Address Here>

Congrats!!! You have captured your first authentication key!!
Now lets get to cracking that Hash!
